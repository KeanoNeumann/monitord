INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

* To compile the library on a unix-like platform, just start the configure
  script. 

  This should generate a makefile which you can use to start building the 
  library using 'make'.

* To compile the library on a MS-Windows platform using Visual C++, you can
  use the project files included in the archive. 
 
  IMPORTANT: As of version 1.2.0, you can choose between two mutex 
             implementations on the MS-Windows platform. By default, the
	     same implementation is used as in previous versions. However,
	     if you'd like the JMutex class to use a CRITICAL_SECTION
	     object rather than a mutex handle, you should uncomment the
	     JMUTEX_CRITICALSECTION define in jmutex.h before compiling
	     the library.
